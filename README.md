# DISCLAIMER

SORRY, MY ENGLISH ISN'T PERFECT GUYS..

# PROJECT DEFINITIONS

It is basically a converter app from PDF format to Excel. It strictly costum for specific format of PDF file in my workplace. Yes, there a couple free applications that identically to this project aim. But I cant find the perfect one to my need. So, here i made my own tool..

## Background

I work in a MRO Company, not as programmer but planner. So, one of my job is documents segregation. It was a document that we need to control as history of every task that performed in a project.

So, all documents are generated by SAP System. The list of all documents from SAP system is our reference incase to collect actual document (printed out) from unit production. The list from SAP System is in PDF format.

## Current Processs & Problem

As the reference for my team to make sure all documents was collected, usually we printed out the List from SAP so we can mark on it. But, for collaborations it was such a mess and gain an independent persuasion.

## Solutions

It would be better if one List Documents file, that editable, use as refference for team. So, i want to make an Excel version of List Documents, put in the Microsoft 365, and everyone involved to control documents have same perspective and persuasion.
